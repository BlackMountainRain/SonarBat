# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our codebase.

## Branch Naming Convention

To keep our branches organized and easy to understand, please follow these naming conventions:

1. **Use lowercase letters**: Use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens (`-`) or slashes (`/`).
    - Example: `feature/new-login-page`, `bugfix/fix-login-error`

2. **Type/Description**: Start the branch name with a type, followed by a brief description.
    - Types: `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `release`, `chore`, `refactor`
    - Examples: `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/null-pointer-exception`

3. **Include task ID if applicable**: If you are referencing a specific task or issue, include the task ID from your task management tool (e.g., GitHub Issues).
    - Examples: `feature/1234-user-authentication`, `bugfix/5678-fix-login-error`

4. **Keep branch names short**: Avoid long descriptions to keep branch names concise.
    - Examples: `feature/add-user-profile`, `bugfix/fix-login-button`

5. **Prefix convention**: For specific teams or projects, define prefix conventions if needed.
    - Examples: `dev/feature-login`, `test/bugfix-authentication`

6. **Release branches**: Include the version number in release branches.
    - Examples: `release/1.0.0`, `hotfix/1.0.1`

7. **Avoid special characters**: Do not use spaces, special characters, or non-ASCII characters in branch names.

Example branch names:
- `feature/add-user-profile`
- `bugfix/fix-login-button`
- `hotfix/urgent-payment-bug`
- `release/2.0.0`
- `chore/update-dependencies`
- `refactor/improve-performance`
